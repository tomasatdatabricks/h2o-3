    //  commit 1 - only Py files are changed -> only Py stages are created
    //           - if we have created the empty R stages as well,
    //             they are marked as SUCCESFUL (no tests -> (almost) nothing to fail)
    //  commit 2 - we add some R changes and we use rerun -> Py stages are skipped, they were successful in previous build
    //           - however, if we had created the empty R stages,
    //             they will be skipped as well, because they are marked as SUCESSFUL in previous build
    // This is why the stages for not changed langs must NOT be created.
    // On the other hand, empty stages for those being reran must be created.
    // Otherwise the rerun mechanism will not be able to distinguish if the
    // stage is missing in previous build  because it was skipped due to the
    // change detection (and it should be run in this build) or because it was
    // skipped due to the rerun (and it shouldn't be run in this build either).
